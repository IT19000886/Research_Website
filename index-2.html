          <h2>Project</h2>
		  
		  <br><p class="animate__animated animate__fadeInUp justify" ><b>Literature Survey</b><br>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">The client values clothing fit exceptionally. On the off chance that the fit is poor, 
          a decent plan, expensive texture, and different parts of the dress are pointless. 
          A well-fitting piece of clothing has a prettier appearance and is more agreeable; 
          conversely, an inadequately fitting piece of clothing will not be worn and probably won't be sold.
          Rice and Beans (2014) Comfort in dress is affected by body aspects,texture qualities,and example development,including ease permitted. 
          The contrast between the article of clothing and body estimations is known as the simplicity remittance 
          it has two capabilities: fit ease for body movements and style ease for article of clothing plan.
           The simplicity incorporates all the solace, capability, oversize, and texture characteristic characteristics. 
           Ease fills in as a cradle when an individual's actual qualities don't adjust to a particular size .

		  <br><p class="animate__animated animate__fadeInUp"><b>Research Problem</b><br>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
          Fashion has never been consistent. At the end of the day it has been changing continually starting with one structure then onto the next and we can, accordingly, say it is dynamic. 
          With so many style originators from one side of the planet to the other, the design business is a speedy industry and it is consistently refreshing the plans of dress. 
          Even Though there have been many systems developed but most of the things are not familiar and easy to use for the users. 
          Implementing electronic commerce is difficult since the textile and garment sectors have so many unique characteristics. 
          The first, and maybe most significant, issue is how hard it is to describe the product effectively online. 
          Color, feel, and fit are just a few of the aspects of a garment that are essential to how consumers make decisions yet are difficult, if not impossible, to convey "online."
        </p>
		  <br><p class="animate__animated animate__fadeInUp"><b>Proposed Solution</b><br>
          <p style="text-align: justify;"> The improvement of the proposed study goes through certain stages. At first clients will be expected to give the estimations as info and afterward with the estimation given those will be saved in the database and a QR code will be generated. 
            A recommending model need to be developed to get the data from customer regarding their measurement and align them to the universal measurements. 
            For that preparing information should be gathered and the proposal model will be made utilizing AI calculations.
            For the data setting, data mining is used. Data mining focuses on the discover of the properties in data as analysis step of database. </p>
          
		  <br><p class="animate__animated animate__fadeInUp"><b>Research Objectives</b><br>
          <p  style="text-align: justify;">The main key objective of this research is to develop a system to be used in the fashion industry as a Smart Fit-On. 
            This will help the customers as they don’t need to use the Fit-On room as to try the dress and select the size. 
            Instead of that time wasting process they can provide their size details as in the mobile application and using that our system will be able to prompt a size most-suitable for the customer. 
            Customers can upload their image which will used by the system for image processing as overlapping the dress and the image of the customer and it will be displayed. 
            Even though they can use the live video function As system will read the customer’s video system will check customer’s body and the dress will be overlapped over the body so they can lively check their style and the dress suitability without wear those dresses.</p>
